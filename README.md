About Me</br>
My name is Virendra, and I am passionate about game development using Unreal Engine 5. I have been actively exploring and creating gameplay mechanics to strengthen my skills and build a strong foundation in interactive design and development.

Project Overview
As part of my development journey, I have created several core gameplay systems in Unreal Engine 5, including:

Block Trial – A gameplay system designed with the intent to utilize both Blueprints and C++. High-level logic and visual scripting are handled through Blueprints, while low-level systems and performance-critical components are implemented in C++.
This project allowed me to understand and balance the strengths of both approaches within Unreal Engine.</br>

Runner End – An endless runner-style mechanic that challenges players with fast-paced navigation and obstacles.

TPS Character – A third-person shooter setup featuring character movement, aiming, and shooting systems.

Strike Hidden – A stealth-based mechanic where players must locate and strike hidden targets within a game environment.

That Button Again-Every room has one goal: escape.And one thing in common: that button.
In this looping puzzle-platformer, each room contains a single button, but its effect changes every time. Press it to spawn objects, activate lasers, move platforms, or trigger something totally unexpected.
Solve the puzzle using whatever chaos the button brings.
It’s the same button. Again and again.
But the puzzle? Never the same.</br>

These projects demonstrate my ability to implement diverse gameplay systems and my growing expertise in UE5.
